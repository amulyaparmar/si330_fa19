    "Imagine this hypothetical situation, I'm sitting out in the backyard with my daughter (Katie) and we're watching the squirrels climb along the trees. We jointly name each squirrel, and identify their type (e.g. a gray squirel versus a chipmunk). Then I try and find the out which kinds of trees the squirrels live in, while Katie tries to see the speed at which the squirrels run on different species of trees. So we have two `DataFrame` objects created, one about squirrels and their living conditions, and one about squirrels and their observed speed."
